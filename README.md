# Crypto Balance Dashboard

This is a prototype for a React based crypto balances dashboard application.

The application uses a Python backend to process Coinbase reports which are then fetched by the React frontend dashboard.

# Python Backend

The backend used to process Coinbase report data is implemented in Python. Report data is processed into the relevant information for each coin and the results stored in .json files to be fetched by the React frontend.

Wallet and price information generated by the Python backend are stored as json files in the following folders:

- The wallet data are stored in the [CryptoDashboardApp/public/Wallets](./CryptoDashboardApp/public/Wallets) folder
- Daily price information for the past year is stored in the [CryptoDashboardApp/public/Prices](./CryptoDashboardApp/public/Prices) folder

In future I will updgrade the backend to a simple Flask app so that it can function as a rudimentary API for the React frontend.

Currently, reports are not fetched using the Coinbase API but must be uploaded by the user. The rest is handled automatically using the Coinbase API to fetch price data etc.

# React Frontend

The frontend is created with node/react. This simply fetches the .json data generated by the backend and displays the information appropriately. All calculations are done on the backend to minimise the processing (headaches) through JavaScript.
